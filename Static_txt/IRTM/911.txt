In a sister act on adjoining courts, Venus and Serena Williams each 
yielded just five games, had winning stretches of seven games, and 
made unwanted mistakes. Heading toward a possible semifinal meeting 
in the Australian Open, both advanced to the round of 16 on Saturday, 
spending less than an hour in temperatures magnified to 125 degrees 
by sun reflecting off the courts. Venus, the Wimbledon, U.S. Open 
and Olympic champion, beat Czech player Denisa Chladkova 6-4, 6-1, 
serving eight aces at speeds up to 118 mph. Serena won 6-1, 6-4 against 
Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn. Top seed Martina Hingis, who could 
prevent a sisters' meeting, reached the fourth round by coming back 
from 2-4 to beat wild card entry Virginie Razzano of France 7-5, 6-1. 
``It was very hot. I didn't really want to make my stay too long,'' 
Venus Williams said. ``Today was pretty fortunate.'' The air temperature 
was 93 degrees, but thermometers at courtside soared higher. Clouds 
lowered the temperature to 75 for some of the later matches. After 
gaining an early break, Venus said, she was hurt by unforced errors. 
But the No. 3 seed started a seven-game winning streak at 4-4, taking 
her to 5-0 in the second set in the main stadium court. Serena won 
seven in a row after being broken in the first game. But then Tamarine 
broke twice and held twice for a 4-3 lead in the second set, and Serena 
had to break again in the ninth game with some heavy hitting to set 
up the victory on nearby Court 1. ``I was pretty disappointed with 
the way I played today,'' Serena said. ``It's not that I wouldn't 
move my feet _ I couldn't. It was very weird. ``The wind was chasing 
the ball a little, and I just didn't do the things that I want to 
do,'' the No. 6 seed added. The wind seemed much stronger on Serena's 
court, which has lower walls than the adjoining Rod Laver Arena where 
Venus played. In her fourth round, Serena plays the winner of a night 
match between Olympic silver medalist Elena Dementieva, the No. 9 
seed, and Czech player Daja Bedanova. Venus meets No. 13 Amelie Mauresmo, 
the 1999 Australian runner-up, who beat Croatia's Iva Majoli 6-4, 
6-2. No. 7 Mary Pierce, the French Open champion, became the fifth 
women's seed to lose, falling 6-3, 6-2 to Argentina's Paola Suarez. 
Suarez next plays No. 10 Amanda Coetzer, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over German 
Marlene Weingartner, and Hingis meets Italy's Rita Grande, who beat 
Australian Evie Dominikovic 6-3, 6-4. A fifth seed also lost on the 
men's side. No. 10 Wayne Ferreira, who said he was hampered by a finger 
injury from catching a ball in the warmup, lost 6-0, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 
to 19-year-old Swede Andreas Vinciguerra. Greg Rusedski, who beat 
top seed Gustavo Kuerten, moved on easily by ousting German qualifier 
Lars Burgsmuller 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in 1 hour, 25 minutes. Next up is No. 
15 Andre Clement, who beat Switzerland's Roger Federer 7-6 (5), 6-4, 
6-4. Rusedski said he was pleased at coming back strongly after his 
five-set match with Kuerten. ``That's another positive for me, to 
come off the match feeling physically good and being able to serve 
and volley, serve a high percentage again and play the game I wanted 
to,'' Rusedski said. Olympic gold medalist Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the 
1999 champion and 2000 runner-up here, and 2000 semifinalist Magnus 
Norman both struggled for 2 1/2 hours, starting in the heat and ending 
in cooler temperatures. No. 5 Kafelnikov rallied to beat American 
Chris Woodruff, a quarterfinalist last year, 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. 
``Winning the second set was a huge relief,'' said Kafelnikov, who 
next plays Vinciguerra. ``I knew I was back in the match and my chances 
would come.'' Woodruff said heat wasn't the problem. ``I became a 
little too predictable with the way I'm playing,'' Woodruff said. 
``He seemed to get a good groove.'' No. 4 Norman beat Spain's Alex 
Calatrava 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, to advance to a meeting with 
No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean. Grosjean beat Sweden's Thomas Johansson 
6-4, 6-1, 6-4.
